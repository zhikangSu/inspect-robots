# Inspect Robots

### An open-source evaluation framework for physical AI

Define a robotics benchmark once, then run any policy (LLM agent, VLA) against
any compatible embodiment (a real arm or humanoid, or a simulator) with
auditable logs (grader scores, LLM transcript, full config) and first-class
[Rerun](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun) visualization.

If you know [Inspect AI](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/), this is that for robotics.

---

## Install

In a fresh directory (or your existing project), create a virtual environment
and install:

```bash
uv venv && uv pip install "inspect-robots[rerun]"
```

The `rerun` extra powers the live run viewer. For the numpy-only core:

```bash
uv venv && uv pip install inspect-robots
```

Any venv workflow works. Activate it once (`source .venv/bin/activate`;
`.venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows) and call `inspect-robots` directly. Inside
an existing uv project, avoid `uv run inspect-robots`, which re-syncs to the
lockfile and silently uninstalls what `uv pip install` just added.

## Quickstart

Install the plugin for your rig and set your defaults once:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install inspect-robots-yam   # provides the molmoact2 policy + yam_arms rig
inspect-robots setup
```

The wizard picks your defaults, finds your cameras, and asks about behavior
toggles and numeric settings declared by the embodiment plugin, such as yam's
`auto_start`, then writes `~/.config/inspect-robots/config.ini`. On a different
rig, install its plugin instead and type its component names at the prompts; to
write the config file by hand, see
[the CLI guide](https://docs.inspectrobots.org/guide/cli/).

The `molmoact2` policy is only a client: nothing moves until the MolmoAct2
server is listening, and the server does not start itself or survive a
reboot (full setup in the
[yam plugin README](https://github.com/robocurve/inspect-robots-yam#install-on-the-robotgpu-machine)):

```bash
# On the GPU machine, from the MolmoAct2 repo. Leave it running, e.g. in tmux:
python examples/yam/host_server_yam.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8202
curl http://127.0.0.1:8202/act      # 200 means the server is ready
```

On a different rig, start whatever serves your policy instead; in-process
policies (such as `agent` or the mock `scripted`) need no server.

Then tell the robot what to do:

```bash
inspect-robots "place the fork on the plate"
```

Every run opens a live Rerun viewer streaming the cameras, proprioception,
and actions straight from the eval pipeline, so you watch exactly what the
policy sees while the robot moves, and saves that stream as a replayable `.rrd`
beside the eval log. CLI flags override any default (`--no-rerun-save`,
`--no-rerun`, `--no-store-frames`, `--max-steps 300`, ...).

### Drive the robot with an LLM

The policy slot is not limited to VLAs. With the
[inspect-robots-agent](plugins/inspect-robots-agent/) plugin, a frontier LLM
drives the same rig through tool calls, one approver-checked motion chunk
per call.

Put a `.env` with your API key in the working directory (the CLI loads it
automatically; [.env.example](.env.example) is a template):

```ini
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

Install the add-on:

```bash
uv pip install inspect-robots-agent
```

Run the LLM on the robot:

```bash
inspect-robots "place the fork on the plate" --policy agent \
    -P model=anthropic/claude-fable-5 -P effort=low
```

Read the recorded agent conversation with
`inspect-robots inspect LOG.json --transcript`, or open the HTML report with
`inspect-robots view LOG.json`. For `--store-frames` runs it includes the
camera frames the model saw. Once a few runs have accumulated,
`inspect-robots view logs/` renders them all and builds a browsable index.

### Fast Opus 5 streamed to a remote Rerun viewer

The same agent policy can run Claude Opus 5 in
[fast mode](plugins/inspect-robots-agent/README.md#fast-mode-on-claude) at
high thinking effort, streaming the rollout live to a Rerun viewer on your
laptop (`rerun` locally, then `ssh -R 9876:localhost:9876 <robot>` for the
tunnel). The explicit `run --instruction` form keeps the instruction on the
last line, so the operator only ever edits the end of the command:

```bash
inspect-robots run --policy agent --rerun-connect \
    -P model=anthropic/claude-opus-5 -P wire=messages -P speed=fast \
    -P effort=high \
    --instruction "place the fork on the plate"
```

### Talk to the policy while it runs

With the [voice plugin](plugins/inspect-robots-voice/) installed, `--voice`
keeps the microphone open for the whole run and delivers each spoken remark to
the policy at its next inference, transcribed locally (no keys, no network).
Silence sends nothing, and voice is feedback-only: ending an episode and
recording verdicts stay on the keyboard.

```bash
pip install inspect-robots-voice
inspect-robots run --policy agent -P model=anthropic/claude-opus-5 \
    --voice \
    --instruction "place the fork on the plate"
```

Typed console feedback keeps working alongside; both land in the transcript
and the eval log with their source recorded.

### Retry with learning

Summarize a failed log into a learnings file, then pass those notes to the
next agent run:

```bash
inspect-robots summarize logs/failed-run.json
inspect-robots "place the fork on the plate" --policy agent \
    -P prior_learnings=logs/learnings/failed-run.md
```

The `summarize` command produces the markdown file. The policy reads it once
and records its resolved path and content hash in the eval configuration.

### Generate robot policy code with CaP-X

The [inspect-robots-capx](plugins/inspect-robots-capx/) plugin evaluates a
code-as-policy agent in the same policy slot. The LLM writes Python against
SAM3 segmentation, Contact-GraspNet planning, Pyroki IK, and speed-limited
joint-motion helpers.

```bash
uv pip install inspect-robots-capx

inspect-robots "place the fork on the plate" --policy capx \
    --embodiment <joint-space-embodiment> \
    -P model=anthropic/claude-fable-5 -P sam3_url=http://gpu-box:8114
```

See the [plugin README](plugins/inspect-robots-capx/) for embodiment
requirements, model-server bringup, and the model-code trust boundary.

### Run in simulation

The same instruction runs on your configured simulator instead of the
real robot:

```bash
inspect-robots "place the fork on the plate" --sim
```

### Browse your runs

Every run writes an eval log; pass the whole directory to `view` and each log
is rendered into `logs/html/` behind a filterable `index.html` — when,
instruction, policy/model, status, metrics, termination, and error for each
run, newest first, with rows linking to the per-log HTML reports:

```bash
inspect-robots view logs/
```

Re-runs are incremental (only new or changed logs are re-rendered; `--force`
re-renders everything, e.g. after changing `--no-frames` or
`--frames-budget`). Open the statically rendered index directly with `--open`.

To render, serve, and open the index locally, leave this running:

```bash
inspect-robots view logs/ --serve --open
```

New runs appear automatically while the index is served. On a headless robot
host, bind to the network and open the printed URL from your laptop:

```bash
inspect-robots view logs/ --serve --host 0.0.0.0
```

`--host 0.0.0.0` exposes the viewer to anyone who can reach the machine; they
can view the logs, including embedded camera frames. The served index
auto-refreshes as new runs arrive.

Agent runs update their HTML report turn by turn while the run is active.
Scores appear when the canonical final log replaces the running snapshot.

### More CLI commands

The full command line resolves any registered task/policy/embodiment
(builtins + installed plugins). List what is registered:

```bash
inspect-robots list
```

Run a registered task with explicit components:

```bash
inspect-robots run --task cubepick-reach --policy scripted --embodiment cubepick
```

Pretty-print a saved eval log:

```bash
inspect-robots inspect logs/cubepick-reach_*.json
```

Distill a saved log into a markdown learnings file:

```bash
inspect-robots summarize logs/cubepick-reach_*.json
inspect-robots summarize logs/cubepick-reach_*.json --model claude-sonnet-4-5
```

Without `--model`, the command writes a deterministic offline digest. With a
model, it sends the digest and bounded transcript tails to an OpenAI-compatible
chat endpoint. Output defaults to `logs/learnings/<log-stem>.md`; use `-o FILE`
to choose a path or `-o -` for stdout.

Render a saved eval log as a self-contained HTML report, or a whole logs
directory as a browsable index (see [Browse your runs](#browse-your-runs)):

```bash
inspect-robots view logs/cubepick-reach_*.json
inspect-robots view logs/
```

Render a `--store-frames` run's camera frames to MP4 videos (needs the
`ffmpeg` binary on PATH):

```bash
inspect-robots video logs/cubepick-reach_*.json
```

### Python API

Everything is a Python API. No hardware or simulator needed: the
dependency-free `CubePick` mock world exercises the whole stack:

```python
from inspect_robots import eval
from inspect_robots.mock import CubePickEmbodiment, ScriptedPolicy
from inspect_robots.scene import Scene
from inspect_robots.scorer import success_at_end
from inspect_robots.task import Task

task = Task(
    name="cubepick-reach",
    scenes=[Scene(id=f"layout-{i}", instruction="reach the cube", init_seed=i) for i in range(5)],
    scorer=success_at_end(),
    max_steps=80,
)

# The two swappable inputs: a policy (VLA) and an embodiment (robot/sim).
(log,) = eval(task, ScriptedPolicy(), CubePickEmbodiment())
print(log.status, log.results.metrics)   # success {'success_at_end': 1.0}
```

## Supported embodiments

An embodiment is registered through an entry point, so installing its package is
all it takes to make it appear in `inspect-robots list` and resolve under
`--embodiment`. Each rig package ships both halves of the eval: the embodiment
and the policy clients that speak the same action contract, so the pair passes
the compatibility check without extra configuration.

### Real robots

| Robot | `--embodiment` | Package | Action contract | Policies in the same package |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [I2RT YAM](https://i2rt.com/products/yam-6-dof-arm) bimanual arms | `yam_arms` | [inspect-robots-yam](https://github.com/robocurve/inspect-robots-yam) | 14-D `joint_pos` (2 × [6 joints + gripper]) | `molmoact2`, `gr00t` |
| [Franka](https://franka.de/) FR3 and Panda | `franka` | [inspect-robots-franka](https://github.com/robocurve/inspect-robots-franka) | 8-D `joint_pos` (7 joints + gripper) | `openpi` |
| [AgiBot](https://www.agibot.com/) A2 Ultra dual arms | `a2_arms` | [inspect-robots-agibot-a2](https://github.com/robocurve/inspect-robots-agibot-a2) | 16-D `joint_pos` (2 × [7 joints + gripper]) | `go1`, `openpi` |
| [Unitree G1](https://www.unitree.com/g1) arms, standing | `g1_arms` | [inspect-robots-unitree-g1](https://github.com/robocurve/inspect-robots-unitree-g1) | 16-D `joint_pos` (2 × [7 joints + gripper]) | `gr00t` |
| [SO-ARM](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100) followers (SO-100 / SO-101) | `so_arm` | [inspect-robots-so101](https://github.com/robocurve/inspect-robots-so101) | 6-D `joint_pos` | `lerobot` |
| WidowX 250S | `widowx` | [inspect-robots-widowx](https://github.com/robocurve/inspect-robots-widowx) | 7-D `eef_delta_pose` | `openvla`, `openpi` |
| Any ROS 1 or ROS 2 arm through rosbridge | `ros` | [inspect-robots-ros](plugins/inspect-robots-ros/) | `joint_pos`, width set by the joints you list | — |
| [ARX (方舟无限) R5](https://github.com/ARXroboticsX/R5) single or dual arms | `arx_r5` | [inspect-robots-arx-r5](plugins/inspect-robots-arx-r5/) | 7-D or 14-D `joint_pos` (6 joints + gripper per arm) | — |

Trossen discontinued the WidowX 250S in July 2025. That adapter supports
existing 250S rigs; the successor WidowX AI uses a different stack.

New robot integrations are welcome. If your rig is not listed,
[Authoring an embodiment adapter](https://docs.inspectrobots.org/guide/adapters/)
walks through both halves of the pair, and opening an issue with the robot and
its SDK is a good first step.

### Simulation and mock

| World | `--embodiment` | Package | Action contract |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Isaac Lab](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/) | `isaacsim` | [inspect-robots-isaacsim](plugins/inspect-robots-isaacsim/) | `joint_pos`, arm joints of the loaded task plus a gripper |
| `CubePick`, no hardware or GPU | `cubepick` | built into `inspect-robots` | 2-D `eef_delta_pos` |

The `ros` embodiment is the general escape hatch: any arm that publishes
standard joint and compressed-image topics works without a dedicated package.
The rig packages exist for robots whose SDKs are not ROS, or where the safety
envelope, camera wiring, and reset behavior are worth encoding once.

Policies are swappable independently of all of this. `agent` (a frontier LLM)
and `xpolicylab` (40+ served VLAs) adapt to whichever embodiment they are paired
with; `capx` (code-as-policy) needs a joint-space one. A mismatch is caught by
the compatibility check before anything moves, not mid-rollout.

## Why Inspect Robots

- **Real-world first.** Interfaces assume real-robot reality: human-in-the-loop
  reset, no privileged success oracle, wall-clock control rate. Simulators just
  offer more (seeding, privileged success, rendering) via opt-in capabilities.
- **Compatibility checked up front.** Before any rollout, the
  `(policy, embodiment)` pair is validated (action/observation spaces,
  semantics, control rate, scene realizability) and fails fast if not.
- **Auditable.** Every run yields an immutable, schema-versioned `EvalLog`
  with the resolved config, git revision, and package versions. It is re-readable
  across releases and re-scorable offline.
- **Light core.** Depends only on NumPy. Rerun and simulator/VLA backends are
  optional extras and separately installable plugins.
- **Safe unattended.** An explicit error taxonomy separates "record and continue"
  from "halt and require a human", so a faulted robot never auto-advances overnight.
- **Rerun visualization.** Stream camera images, 3D poses, joint/action
  time-series, and success markers to a `.rrd` recording. Logging is non-blocking:
  a slow viewer connection drops camera frames first (whole steps only under
  sustained stall) instead of delaying the robot control loop, and camera
  streams are JPEG-compressed by default.
- **Pluggable.** Backends ship as separate packages: the first-party plugins
  below, and rig plugins like `inspect-robots-yam`. Entry points make them
  appear in `inspect-robots list` automatically.
- **VLA-native.** Action chunking, open-loop execution, and ACT/ALOHA temporal
  ensembling are built in, with action *semantics* (control mode, rotation
  representation, gripper, frame) that make compatibility and ensembling correct.

## First-party plugins

Policies, embodiments, and attended operator input have ready-made plugins
shipped from this repo as separate packages:

- **[inspect-robots-ros](plugins/inspect-robots-ros/)**: run evals on ROS 1 or
  ROS 2 arms through rosbridge, with no ROS installation on the eval machine
  (`--embodiment ros`).
- **[inspect-robots-isaacsim](plugins/inspect-robots-isaacsim/)**: run evals
  against an [Isaac Lab](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/) simulation
  (`--embodiment isaacsim`).
- **[inspect-robots-xpolicylab](plugins/inspect-robots-xpolicylab/)**: drive
  any [XPolicyLab](https://github.com/XPolicyLab/XPolicyLab)-served policy.
  One adapter puts its zoo of 40+ VLAs (π0/π0.5, GR00T, OpenVLA-OFT, RDT-1B,
  SmolVLA, ACT, …) behind `--policy xpolicylab -P url=ws://gpu-box:19000`.
- **[inspect-robots-agent](plugins/inspect-robots-agent/)**: let a frontier
  LLM (Claude, GPT, anything behind an OpenAI-compatible API) drive any
  embodiment through tool calls, as a first-class policy. The same
  `--policy agent` runs ad-hoc instructions and scores on registered tasks
  next to fine-tuned VLAs. A programmatic motion pre-check hook can return
  correctable rejection reasons before absolute action chunks are emitted.
- **[inspect-robots-capx](plugins/inspect-robots-capx/)**: evaluate CaP-X-style
  code-as-policy agents against a joint-space embodiment. Model-generated
  Python calls separately served SAM3, Contact-GraspNet, and Pyroki helpers,
  then queues approver-checked joint targets behind `--policy capx`.
- **[inspect-robots-voice](plugins/inspect-robots-voice/)**: transcribe local
  microphone speech into operator feedback during attended runs with
  `--voice`, or narrate streamed policy notes and terminal summaries with
  `run --speak`. Spoken input is feedback-only, so trial end and verdicts stay
  on the keyboard.

```bash
# Isaac Lab world + a π0 checkpoint served by XPolicyLab, evaluated end to end:
inspect-robots run --task my-task --embodiment isaacsim \
    --policy xpolicylab -P url=ws://gpu-box:19000 -P cameras=cam_head:base_rgb

# Claude driving the mock world, no hardware or GPU required:
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
inspect-robots "pick up the cube" --policy agent \
    -P model=anthropic/claude-fable-5 -P effort=low --embodiment cubepick
```

### Real robots via ROS

The ROS embodiment connects to any ROS 1 or ROS 2 arm that exposes standard
joint, compressed-image, and optional pose topics through `rosbridge_server`.
It publishes joint-position commands at a configured control rate and works
with every compatible policy, including `agent` and XPolicyLab-served VLAs.

```bash
uv pip install inspect-robots-ros

inspect-robots run --task my-task --policy agent --embodiment ros \
    -E url=ws://robot:9090 \
    -E joints=joint1,joint2,joint3,joint4,joint5,joint6 \
    -E command_topic=/joint_trajectory_controller/joint_trajectory \
    -E action_low=-3.1,-2.2,-2.9,-3.1,-2.9,-3.1 \
    -E action_high=3.1,2.2,2.9,3.1,2.9,3.1
```

Swap `--policy agent` for `--policy xpolicylab -P url=ws://gpu-box:19000` to
evaluate any XPolicyLab-served VLA on the same arm; the `-E` robot arguments
stay unchanged. Robot bringup, controller mappings, safety requirements,
camera configuration, and reset behavior are documented in the
[ROS plugin README](plugins/inspect-robots-ros/).

Safety guardrails (a bounds clamp plus a per-step delta limit derived from
the embodiment's action space, followed by any specialized guardrails the
embodiment contributes) are wired into every CLI run by default, for every
policy. Turning them off requires an explicit `--disable-guardrails`.
Persist your usual setup once with `inspect-robots config set embodiment NAME`
and `inspect-robots config set policy NAME`, then a bare
`inspect-robots "wipe the table"` does the rest.

## How it maps to Inspect AI

If you know [Inspect AI](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/), you already know Inspect Robots.

| Inspect AI | Inspect Robots |
|---|---|
| `Model` | `Policy` (VLA) **+** `Embodiment` *(two inputs)* |
| `Task = dataset + solver + scorer` | `Task = scenes + controller + scorer` |
| `Sample` | `Scene` |
| `Solver` chain | `Controller` middleware (chunking, ensembling, smoothing) |
| `eval()` → `EvalLog` | `eval()` → `EvalLog` |
| `@task` / `@solver` / `@scorer` + registry | `@task` / `@policy` / `@embodiment` / `@scorer` + entry points |

This repository is the framework. Concrete benchmarks live in
[WorldEvals](https://github.com/robocurve/worldevals), the benchmark catalog,
and backend adapters live in separate plugin packages.
